## Hi there, Welcome to my GitHub! 👋

## 🙋‍♂️ About me

![Profile views](https://komarev.com/ghpvc/?username=minolirm)

I’m a Data Science Post Graduate with strong expertise in Statistics, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I’m teaching Machine Learning to Post-Bacc students in the Applied Data Science program at Thompson Rivers University, British Columbia, Canada 📚👨‍🏫💻. 

### 🚀 I'm a huge fan of:

<p align="center"> Open-source data science projects, innovative Machine Learning (ML) initiatives, and cutting-edge Natural Language Processing (NLP) applications. I’m particularly interested in tackling challenges related to: </p>
Building Scalable Machine Learning Models: Whether it's predicting future trends, improving classification systems, or creating recommendation engines, I’m eager to apply machine learning in real-world scenarios.

Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Generation (NLG): Working on projects that focus on enhancing the interaction between machines and human language. This includes developing sophisticated chatbots, sentiment analysis tools, or language translation systems.

Data Visualization and Exploration: Helping teams turn complex data into intuitive, actionable insights with the use of interactive dashboards, advanced plotting libraries, and storytelling through data.

Automating Data Science Pipelines: Leveraging tools like AutoML, MLOps, and cloud services to automate data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment. The goal is to enhance efficiency and reproducibility.

Exploring Ethical AI & Fairness: Collaborating on projects that focus on the ethical implications of AI and machine learning, ensuring that algorithms are transparent, fair, and inclusive.

Collaborative Research in AI and Data Science: Engaging in research that explores new methodologies in deep learning, reinforcement learning, or applying machine learning to novel fields like healthcare, climate modeling, and financial forecasting.
